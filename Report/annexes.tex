\section{Linear equations systems}
\subsection{Reachability in a MC}
Let $\mathcal{M} = (S, \Delta, w, AP, L)$ be a MC, $s \in S$ be a state of $\mathcal{M}$ and $T \subseteq S$ be a set of target states in $\mathcal{M}$.
We can compute the probability to reach $T$ from $s$ :
let $(x_s)_{s \in S}$ be a vector of probabilities,
\begin{itemize}
	\item if $s$ is not connected to $T$ in the underlying graph of $\mathcal{M}$, then we have $x_s = 0$
	\item else, if $s \in T$, then we obviously have $x_s = 1$
	\item else, for all $s \in S \setminus T$  such that $s$ is connected to $T$ in the underlying graph of $\mathcal{M}$,
		\[
      x_s = \underbrace{\sum_{s' \in S \setminus T} \Delta(s, s') \cdot x_{s'}}_{\text{reach $T$ via $s' \in S \setminus T$}} + \underbrace{\sum_{t \in T} \Delta(s, t)}_{\text{reach $T$ in one transition}}
    \]
\end{itemize}
This defines a linear equations system.
Let $S_{=0}$ be te subset of states of $S$ that can not reach $T$ in the underlying graph of $\mathcal{M}$, $S_{=1} = T$ and $S_{=?} = S \setminus (S_{=0} \cup S_{=1})$.
The solution $(x_s)_{s \in S_{=?}}$ of this linear equations system is unique and $x_s = \mathbb{P}_s(\Diamond T)$ for all $s \in S$.

\subsection{Expected cost of paths of a MC for reachability properties}
  Let $\mathcal{M} = (S, \Delta, w, AP, L)$ be a MC, $s \in S$ be a state of $\mathcal{M}$ and $T \subseteq$ S be a set of targets states. $\mathbb{E}_s(\Diamond T)$ can be computed through a linear equations system defined as follow :
  %Soient $x_s = \mathbb{E}_s(TS^T)$ %et $S_{=1} = \{s \in S \; | \; \mathbb{P}_s_s(\Diamond T) = 1 \}$
  let $succ(s) = \{ s' \in S \; | \; \Delta(s, s') > 0 \}$ be the set of successors of $s$,
  \[ x_s =
  	\begin{cases}
  	\infty & \quad \text{if } \mathbb{P}_s(\Diamond T) < 1 \\
  	0 & \quad \text{if } s \in T \\
  	\sum_{s' \in succ(s)} \Delta(s, s') \cdot (w(s, s') + x_{s'}) & \quad \text{else}
  	\end{cases}
  \]
Let $S_{=?} = \{ s \in S \; | \; \mathbb{P}_s(\Diamond T) = 1 \} \setminus T$. The solution $(x_s)_{s \in S_{=?}}$ of this linear equations system is unique and $x_s = \mathbb{E}_s(\Diamond T)$ for all $s \in S$.

\section{Cost bounded reachability in a MC}

Let $\mathcal{M} = (S, \Delta, w, AP, L)$ be a MC. We denote by $\mathbb{P}^\mathcal{M}_s$ the probability measure $\mathbb{P}_s$ such that $s \in S$ is a state of the MC $\mathcal{M}$.
Let $s \in S$ be a state of $\mathcal{M}$, $T \subseteq S$ be a set of target states and $l \in \mathbb{N}$, a threshold.
We can compute $\mathbb{P}_s(\Diamond_{\leq l} T)$ by reduction to the reachability problem on $\mathcal{M}_l = (S_l, \Delta_l)$ to the target states set $T_l \subseteq S_l$ that we build as follow :
\begin{itemize}
	\item $S_l$ is composed by states $(s, v)$ such that $s \in S $ and $v \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{ \bot \}$. We consider that $\bot > l$, with $\bot + v = \bot$ for all $v \in \mathbb{N}$. Intuitively, we record in $v$ the cost of paths in $\mathcal{M}$. Target states are states of $T_l = \{ (s, v) \in S_l \; | \; s \in T \wedge v \leq l \}$.
	\item $\Delta_l: S_l \times S_l \rightarrow [0,1]$ is the probability transition function given by:\\
	$\forall (s, v), (s', v') \in S_l,$
	\[
		\Delta_l((s, v), (s', v')) =
		\begin{cases}
		\Delta(s, s') & \text{if $v' = v + w(s, s')$ and $v' \leq b$  or} \\
		 & \text{if $v' = \bot$ and $v + w(s, s') > b$} \\
		 0 & \text{else}
		\end{cases}
	\]
\end{itemize}
\textit{Note} : here, the weight function is ommited in $\mathcal{M}_l$. So, $\mathcal{M}_l$ is unweighted. \\
Resolving the cost bounded reachability by the threshold $l$ from $s$ to $T$ in $\mathcal{M}$ can be done by resolving the reachbility problem from $(s, 0)$ to $T_l$ in $\mathcal{M}_l$, i.e., $\mathbb{P}^\mathcal{M}_s(\Diamond_{\leq l} T) = \mathbb{P}^{\mathcal{M}_l}_{(s, 0)}(\Diamond T_l)$

\section{Linear programs}
\subsection{SR-problem}
Let $\mathcal{M}=(S, A, \Delta, w, AP, L)$ be a MC and $T \subseteq S$ be a set of target states of $\mathcal{M}$. We will resolve the SR-problem by building the strategy $\sigma$ that will maximise the
probability of reaching $T$ from all $s \in S$. In that case, let $s \in S$ be a state of $\mathcal{M}$, if $\mathbb{P}_s^\sigma(\Diamond T) \geq \alpha$, $\sigma$ obviously resolves the
SR-problem. Otherwise, no strategy exist to solve the SR-problem. So, we will first compute $\mathbb{P}_s^{\max}(\Diamond T)$ for all $s \in S$. Let $(x_s)_{s \in S}$
be a probability vector for the following LP :
\[
	\min \sum_{s \in S} x_s
\]
under the constraints :
\begin{flalign*}
	x_s &= 1 \quad &&\forall s \in T, \\
	x_s &= 0 \quad &&\forall s \not\in T \text{ such that $s$ is not connected to $T$ in $G^\mathcal{M}$}, \\
	x_s &\geq \sum_{s' \in S} \Delta(s, \alpha, s') \cdot x_{s'}
	\quad &&\forall \alpha \in A(s) \text{ and } \forall s \not \in T \text{ such
		that $s$ is connected to $T$ in $G^\mathcal{M}$}. \\
	0 &\leq x_s \leq 1 && \forall s \in S
\end{flalign*}
\textit{Note : we denote by $G^\mathcal{M}$ the underlying graph of $\mathcal{M}$}. \\

The optimal solution $(v_s)_{s \in S}$ of this LP is unique and gives the following result :
\[
	v_s = \mathbb{P}_s^{\max}(\Diamond T) \quad \forall s \in S
\]
From this result, we can build a memoryless strategy $\sigma$ such that
$\mathbb{P}^\sigma_s(\Diamond T) = \mathbb{P}^{\max}_s(\Diamond T)$.
To do that, for each state $s$, we build $A^{\max}(s)$, the set of
actions $\alpha \in A(s)$ such that
$
	v_s = \sum_{s' \in S} \Delta(s, \alpha, s') \cdot v_{s'}
$. So, as we have $v_s = \mathbb{P}^{\max}_s(\Diamond T)$, actions of $A^{\max}(s)$
maximise the probability of reaching $T$ from $s$.
Building a strategy that would arbitrarely choose a state from
$A^{\max}(s)$ is not sufficient. Indeed, if we take a state $s$
such that $A^{\max}(s) = \{\alpha, \beta\}$ where $\Delta(s, \beta, t) = 1$
for a certain $t \in T$ and $\Delta(s, \alpha, s) = 1$, we obviously have
that choosing $\alpha$ doesn't allow to reach $T$ passing by $s$.
\\

A selection of action that ensures
the reachability of $T$ in the
MC induced by $\sigma$ is required.
Let $\mathcal{M}^{\max}$ be the MDP that corresponds to $\mathcal{M}$
where the actions $\beta \in A(s) \setminus A^{\max}(s)$ are deleted from $A(s)$
for all $s$ connected to $T$.
By definition, $\mathbb{P}^{\max}_s$ is not affected by this simplification of
$\mathcal{M}$. \\

For all $s$ such that $s$ is connected to $T$ in the underlying graph of
$\mathcal{M}^{\max}$, we denote by $||s||$ the length of the \textit{shortest path} of $s$ to any state of $T$ in the underlying graph of
$\mathcal{M^{\max}}$. Intuitively, computing $||s||$ allow to avoid that $\sigma$ chooses
actions that prevent $s$ of reaching $T$.
\begin{itemize}
	\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{\tiny$\bullet$}
	\item $||s|| = 0$ iff $s \in T$.
	\item Let $n \in \mathbb{N}_0$. By induction on $n$, we define
		$\sigma(s)$ for each $s$ connected to $T$ in the underlying graph of
		$\mathcal{M^{\max}}$ and such that $||s|| = n$.
		The strategy chooses an action $\sigma(s) \in A^{\max}(s)$ such that there exists $s' \in Succ(s, \sigma(s))$ where $\Delta(s, \sigma(s), s') > 0$, with $s'$ connected to $T$ in the underlying graph of
		$\mathcal{M}^{\max}$ and $||s'|| = n - 1$. An action $\sigma(s) \in A(s)$ is chosen
		arbitrarely for states $s$ that are not connected to $T$ in the underlying graph of $\mathcal{M}$.
\end{itemize}
We build $\sigma$ this way : let $s \in S$ be a state of $\mathcal{M}$ and $\mathbb{A}(s) = \{\alpha \in A^{\max}(s) \; | \; \exists s' \in Succ(s,
	\alpha), \, ||s'|| = ||s|| - 1 \}$,
\[
	\sigma(s) = \arg \max_{\alpha \in \mathbb{A}(s)} \sum_{s' \in Succ(s, \alpha)} \Delta(s,
	\alpha, s') \cdot v_{s'}
\]
