\chapter{Model checking for Markov decision processes}

Storm allows to model-check discrete-time models, i.e.,
verify that properties hold in states of models. This
chapter will cover model checking via \textit{probabilistic branching time logic}: syntax, semantic and implementation.
We will see that it is possible to extend this logic to support weights of MCs and MDPs. Then, we will see that is
possible to formulate requests with this logic to solve
problems that we have seen in the first chapter and that we
will address in the following chapter, covering multi-objective support for MDPs.
